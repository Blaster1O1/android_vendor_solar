Solar ROM
===========
Pretty much just testing out creating a ROM

Getting started
---------------

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:
```
repo init -u git://github.com/Blaster1O1/SolarROM_android.git -b lineage-16.0
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
